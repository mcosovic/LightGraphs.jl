    struct Katz <: CentralityMeasure
        α::Float64=0.3)

A struct describing an algorithm to calculate the [Katz centrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katz_centrality)
of the graph `g` optionally parameterized by `α`. Return a vector representing
the centrality calculated for each node in `g`.

It is also possible to pass in a matrix of weights for weighted Katz centrality.

### Optional Parameters
- `α::Real=0.3`: the Katz centrality attenuation factor.
- `normalize=true`: If true, normalize the centrality values by scaling the values by `norm`.
